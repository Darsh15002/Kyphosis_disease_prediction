# Kyphosis_disease_prediction

Kyphosis is an abnormal disease that occurs when there is an abnormal excessive curvature on the spinal cord on the human. The dataset used in this project has in total 81 rows and 4 column. It represents the data of the children who have had corrective spinal surgery. Dataset contains 3 inputs and 1 output fileds.

Inputs:
Age: in months
Number: the number of vertebrae involved
Start: the number of first (topmost) vertebra operated on

Output:
Kyphosis: a factor with levels "absent" or "present" indicating if a keyboard (a type of deformation) was present after the operation.
